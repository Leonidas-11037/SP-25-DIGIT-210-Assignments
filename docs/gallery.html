        <p class="mono"><i>A self portrait I painted a while ago during my ART 50 class. Personally, I could do a better job today. Or at least make it more stylized.</i></p>
        <p>Here's some info about myself, where I've been and what I like. Just don't go in here looking for a weakness. I will know.</p>
        <h2>Where in the World was I?</h2>
        <p>I've been to many places, seen some faces, and went through some contemplations. Here's a short highlight reel of what that was like.</p>
            <img src="images/Film%20Project.PNG" style="width:50%;height:50%"/>
            <p class="mono"><i>a screenshot of a short film I completed during ART 168. I take set design very seriously.</i></p>

        <p class="mono"><i>A local arcade I went to in Texas years ago. This PvZ arcade game recenty got uploaded and preserved on the internet.</i></p>

        <h2>Projects I've Made</h2>
        <p>And now, some of my greatest achievements I've accomplished ever since I arrived at Penn State.</p>
         <h3>Interactive 3D Room Scan</h3>
            <iframe width="960" height="540" data-original-width="640" data-original-height="360" src="https://www.thinglink.com/view/scene/1952123638320726502"  style="border: none;"></iframe>
            <p/>
            <a href="https://www.thinglink.com/card/1952123638320726502">The original web version can be found here.</a>
            <p class="mono">The idea was to use Thinglink to make a 3D scan of the Varia Lab server room and create a fiction story around it using annotations. The style of writing was inspired by classic horror games influencing several beats from a fictional game series that took place in the future. I'm not spoiling which ones.</p>

            <h2>Favorite Tracks</h2>
        <p>It's not copyright infringement if I link to someone else's rip instead of mine. Right?</p>
        <p style="background:black;color:red">And now, I shall combine what I observed and create an <q>ordered list</q> using <q>href</q> of tracks from games I like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/PXUduwenXSI?si=6m7v-DbZkF8irrJO">Ketchaku R&amp;D Arranged: The King of Fighters '94</a> (The final boss is cheap. I main him when I get the chance.)</li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/zyADNaIGBaI?si=8JA5DsardUoK1SFQ">Cannon Ball: Rockman Zero 3 Mythos</a> (<q style="color:red">But there's no law that states a copy can't defeat the original.</q>)</li>
            <li>HALL, BASS, and MELODY: The King of Fighters '95 (Located within the 3D model scan)</li>

    <h2>Other Things I Like</h2>
        <p>I like things. It's common to like things. It's just not often anyone asks about mine. Here's a few of them.</p>

        <video controls="controls"> <source src="images/zero-good-job.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>
        <p class="mono">I learned how to add video files in here. Good job making it this far.</p>
            <img src="images/haul.jpg" style="width:50%"/>
        <p class="mono">Here's a haul of some games I bought from a local retro shop. You can find some great stuff just by roaming around the area. </p>
        <p> I love collecting retro video games, for I believe it's important to understand the past to appreciate how we got here. I'll also fancy a modern re-release with extra features. I love all kinds of games from platformers to fighters as you could probably tell from the above visuals. I believe game preservation is very important since it is a still developing form of art and culture. Just like a movie, book, or painting, games deserve to be preserved and experienced by future generations. Yes, even the bad ones. I'm also known as the guy with the PS2 in his dorm.</p>
        <p class="mono">You may 1v1 me on Friday nights at 8 PM at the lounge.</p></section>
