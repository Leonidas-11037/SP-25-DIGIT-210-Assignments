            <p>I am a DIGIT student whos first part of this career path was DIGIT 110. So I didn't know much about making an html site. The project of that class required making one, but my partners put themselves up to it and said, "Don't worry about it. Just edit this one element." I ultimately had fun working on this site, because it allowed me to express part of who I am in my own way. I made my own on-site color pallete and put sections within sections for a segmented look. If I wanted to add a background music track, I can take this video I ripped from my ART 168 class and look up how to configure that into an object that only plays the audio.</p>

<p>The thing about html is that you have to look up how everything works, how many ways the same thing can be worked into it, and how the elements can interact with each other. But once you do, you realize how much power you have here and can create so many things. Sure, this site looks like one of those "ugly" sites from the early days of the internet, but that's what gives everyone's sites in this class charm and character. I modified the style.css sheet and created my own feel in this virtual space. I enjoy learning html and learning new techniques both in class and on my own and would like to continue to do so onward.</p>
<p/>
        <p>HOWEVER: I cannot say the same for creating a site on Wordpress. It's hard to explain. It feels like there's a lower skill floor with the ability to drag and drop your way to creating a website. You don't need any coding knowlage to make a site so, I shouldn't be complaining right? Wrong, it's my right to complain about what I don't like and here's one. The way you make more pages to put in the navagate pages menu is just clunky and awkward. The spellcheck in the code editor view is useless compared to the likes of using oXygen. I guess the comments are kinda neat except I currently don't have a use for it. Fortunalely for me, I'm aware that hacking these sites are apparently so easy it is considered a tutorial in one's hacking degree. That means I have a valid excuse to not use it. Unless it's 200% nessacary to pass a course, I'm probably not going to use Wordpress ever again. I just don't like it.</p>
