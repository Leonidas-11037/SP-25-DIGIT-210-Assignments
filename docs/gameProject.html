        <p>For the final DIGIT 100 project of the semester, we were tasked with finding and playing a game from online. Then we created a spreadsheet consisting of elements within the game and how they're related to each other. After that, we exported the sheet into a <a href="https://kumu.io/">Kumu network</a> to create and embed it to a page. Finally, we combined the visualized data and our notes to create a page dedicated to the game being reviewed.</p>
        <p>The game in question is called <b>e-scape</b>, created by Olivia Haines for the <b>A Game By its Cover 2021</b> game jam.</p>
        <a href="https://livvy.itch.io/escape">The original game can be downloaded here.</a>
        <p/>
        <p>(I highly recommend checking out and playing the game before heading any further down. It is an experience after all.)</p>
