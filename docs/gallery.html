        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/film-thumb.PNG" style="width:50%;height:50%"/>
        <p class="mono"><i>Placeholder opening self portrait. Replace before this goes live.</i></p>
        <p>Here's some info about myself, where I've been and what I like. Just don't go in here looking for a weakness. I will know.</p>
        <h2>Where in the World was I?</h2>
        <p>I've been to many places, seen some faces, and went through some contemplations. Here's a short highlight reel of what that was like.</p>
            <img src="images/Film%20Project.PNG" style="width:50%;height:50%"/>
            <p class="mono"><i>a screenshot of a short film I completed last week. I take set design very seriously.</i></p>
        <img src="images/Arcade.jpg" style="width:45%;height:45%" />
        <p class="mono"><i>A local arcade I went to in Texas years ago. This PvZ arcade game recenty got uploaded and preserved on the internet.</i></p>
        <img src="images/Factory.jpg" style="width:45%;height:45%" />
        <p class="mono"><i>A factory we passed through during one of our southern travels.</i></p>
        <h2>Favorite Tracks</h2>
        <p>It's not copyright infringement if I link to someone else's rip instead of mine. Right?</p>
        <p style="background:red">And now, I shall combine what I observed and create an <q>ordered list</q> using <q>href</q> of tracks from games I like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/PXUduwenXSI?si=6m7v-DbZkF8irrJO">Ketchaku R&amp;D Arranged: The King of Fighters '94</a> (The final boss is cheap. I main him when I get the chance.)</li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/zyADNaIGBaI?si=8JA5DsardUoK1SFQ">Cannon Ball: Rockman Zero 3 Mythos</a> (<q style="color:red">But there's no law that states a copy can't defeat the original.</q>)</li>
            <li>*Allan, add a third one in post.*</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Other Things I Like</h2>
        <p>I like things. It's common to like things. It's just not often anyone asks about mine. Here's a few of them.</p>

        <video controls="controls"> <source src="images/zero-good-job.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>
        <p class="mono">I learned how to add video files in here. Jood job making it this far.</p>
            <img src="images/haul.jpg" style="width:50%"/>
        <p class="mono">Here's a haul of some games I bought from a local retro shop. It took me a while to learn how to resize this. I used <q style="background:blue">style="width:50%"</q> for this one.</p>
        <p> I love collecting retro video games, for I believe it's important to understand the past to appreciate how we got here. I'll also fancy a modern re-release with extra features. I fancy all kinds from platformers to fighters as you could probobly tell from the ubove visuals. I'm also known as the guy with the PS2 in his dorm.</p>
        <p class="mono">You may 1v1 me on Friday nights at 8 PM at the lounge.</p>
        <p>And that's all I found as of now. This may seem a little ahead, but I do find the various ways to edit these files very interesting.</p>
