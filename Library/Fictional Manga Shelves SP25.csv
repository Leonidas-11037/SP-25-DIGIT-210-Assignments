Amid his daily drudgery, he finds himself in the grip of an incredible, inexplicable, and uncontrollable phenomenon that rewinds time, a condition that seems to only make his drab life worse. But then, one day, everything changes. A terrible incident forever changes Satoru's life as he knows it ... and with it, comes a ""Revival"" that sends Satoru eighteen years into the past! In the body of his boyhood self, Satoru encounters sights he never imagined he would see again--the smile of his mother, alive and well, his old friends, and Kayo Hinazuki, the girl who was kidnapped and murdered when he was a boy the first time around. To return to the present and prevent the tragedy that brought him back to his childhood in the first place, Satoru begins plotting a way to change Hinazuki's fate ... But up against the clock and a faceless evil, does eleven-year-old Satoru even stand a chance?""--Provided by publisher","2017","2025-03-21 19:03:49","2025-03-24 18:59:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yen Press","New York, NY","eng","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","PN6790.J33 S3413 2017","OCLC: 972733623","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/22860658","physical; interlibrary","Comic books, strips, etc; Graphic novels; Japan; Comics (Graphic works); COMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELS / Manga / Science Fiction; Crimes against Prevention; Man-woman relationship; Man-woman relationships; Offenses against the person; Prevention; Time travel; Translations; Translations into English; Women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First Yen Press edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She has a gallery show of her art, a good job, and a good guy she plans to marry. The culture she grew up in seems very far away--until her brother phones with the news that their father has died. Yumiko returns to Tokyo and finds herself immersed in the rituals of death while also plunged into the rituals of life--fish bars, bullet trains, pagodas--as she confronts the question of where her future really lies. Just So Happens deals both gently and powerfully with grief, identity, and the pressure not to disappoint one's parents, even after they're gone, in a look at the relationships that build the foundation of our lives""--Publisher","2015","2025-03-25 18:06:06","2025-03-25 18:06:21","","","159","","","","","","","","","","Abrams ComicArts","New York, NY","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","PN6790.J33 O24 2014","OCLC: 890623476","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/14098200","physical; web","Comic books, strips, etc; Graphic novels; Japan; Interpersonal relations; London (England); Loss (Psychology)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LMA5KVZT","thesis","2017","Horbinski, Andrea","Manga's Global Century: A History of Japanese Comics, 1905-1989","","","","","https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5rb9x964","This dissertation describes the origins and history of manga (Japanese comics) from 1905-89 as a form of sequential art which, while created in Japan in the early 20th century, was influenced by cinema and comics from abroad in addition to indigenous artistic predecessors. Manga’s history as one of the three great world sequential arts traditions is best understood by comparing manga to comics and bandes dessinées, as I do, in order to evaluate local conditions in Japan more accurately, demonstrating that different factors in each country produced different outcomes and developmental trajectories for each medium as part of the global history of the twentieth century. I consider multiple aspects of manga—its status as a form of Japanese mass media, its transnational position as one of multiple global sequential art traditions, and its distinctive history as a medium of expression in which fans and creators have at all points played equally important, and at times not easily divisible, roles—to tell the story of manga’s beginnings as it moves into its next hundred years.In particular, I describe the history of competing publishing platforms and formats within manga’s development to demonstrate that manga became widespread in Japanese society less because of any intrinsic quality of comics than because of the affordances of the platforms and formats through which it was distributed. Transformations in platform and format were related to the expansion of audiences for manga, as what began as medium devoted to political satire for adults expanded to encompass children and then to young adults in the 1950s and 1960s. Finally, I pay due attention to the development since 1975 of manga fandom, the dôjin sphere, as an unofficial but extremely consequential site of manga production which has now come to dominate the professional manga industry, even as manga has become a subordinate component of the anime media mix.","2017","2025-03-26 17:21:57","2025-03-26 17:22:03","2025-03-26 17:21:57","","","","","","","Manga's Global Century","","","","","UC Berkeley","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","C:\Users\LEOHK\Zotero\storage\58YA4DSR\Horbinski - 2017 - Manga's Global Century A History of Japanese Comics, 1905-1989.pdf","","article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
