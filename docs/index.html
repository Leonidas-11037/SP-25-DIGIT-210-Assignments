        <h1>Beginning HTML</h1>
        <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                <strong>inline</strong> code to feature some text. Here is <a
                href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
            website</a>.</p>
        <p>One of the best resources for learning HTML is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. 
            Here is a reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for styling</a>.</p>
        <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
            page.</p>
        <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
        <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>headings</li>
            <li>paragraphs</li>
            <li>lists</li>
            <li>tables</li>
            <li>images</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. 
            You have to see the difference by viewing in a web browser.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>morning</li>
            <li>noon</li>
            <li>afternoon</li>
            <li>evening</li>
            <li>night</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>That's a Nice HTML File. Unfortunately...</h1>
        <p>...I stole a copy of it from <strong>the-internet-dot-com</strong>. I'm free to edit within this task of derrivative work. As for me, I looked around for what could be done around here. It turns out that if you type <strong>"&lt;"</strong>, oXygen would tell you many possible tags with a short description for each. That makes things WAY easier on my end. Isn't technology wonderful?</p>
        <p style="background:lime">And now, I shall combine what I observed and create an <q>ordered list</q> using <q>href</q> of tracks from games I like:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/PXUduwenXSI?si=6m7v-DbZkF8irrJO">Ketchaku R&amp;D Arranged: The King of Fighters '94</a> (The final boss is cheap. I main him when I get the chance.)</li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/J-1Bob1dU18?si=ls6uoivyhPMiTGZ9">Morning Mood: Edvard Grieg</a> (<q style="color:red">You've heard this track before. You probably don't know the name, but you know what it is.</q>)</li>
            <li>*Allan, add a third one in post.*</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pictures Can Move. Except for When They Don't</h3>
        <p>Now that you've peeked into my personality, here's a peek of my personal collection. With Three Flavors of Visual Aid:</p>

        <video controls="controls"> <source src="images/zero-good-job.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>
        <p style="background:black;color:white">You can insert video files in your html with the &lt;video&gt; tag. Make sure to add controls="controls" in video's attributes and put the source in the &lt;source&gt; tag (As an attribute, similar to img src="folder/image except it's now src="folder/video.mp4") within &lt;video&gt;.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/haul.jpg" style="width:200%"/>
            <figcaption style="background:black;color:white">Here's a haul of some games I bought from a local retro shop. It took me a while to learn how to resize this. I used <q style="background:blue">style="width:200%"</q> for this one.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> As for the caption style, I used style="background:black;color:white" within &lt;figcaption&gt;</p>
        <img src="images/Exiori-XIII.webp" style="width:25%;height:25%"/>
        <p><i>Iori Yagami, rival character who first debut in The King of Fighters '95.</i></p>
        <p style="background:black;color:white">Oh, and if your image file has a transparent background (like a .png or .webp), said background won't be seen here. I put <q>style="width:25%;height:25%</q> as an attribute within &lt;img&gt; to reduce its size. Otherwise this thing would've been massive.</p>
        <p>And that's all I found as of now. This may seem a little ahead, but I do find the various ways to edit these files very interesting.</p>
